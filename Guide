What does the business want to know?

Are we tracking product performance?

Do we want to understand weekly trends?

Are we comparing actual vs. target sales?

Which categories drive the most revenue?

Which SKUs are underperforming compared to the weekly targets?

What are the regional/channel-wise sales trends?
